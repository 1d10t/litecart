### [Installation Instructions]

  What you need:

  * An Apache2 web server running PHP 5.3 or higher
  * A MySQL 5.5+ account

  Please note: Windows machines are not recommended as Windows have limitations that can be a problem down the road.

  If you don't have a web hotel and want to try LiteCart on your local machine, check out AMPPS which can install LiteCart with one click via Softaculous apps library which comes presintalled in AMPPS.

  Instructions
  ------------

  1. Connect to your web host via FTP using your favourite FTP software.

  2. Open the downloaded ZIP-archive and copy the contents of the folder public_html/ (yes the contents inside it - not the folder itself) to your web site root directory.

  Example:

  /var/www/
  /home/username/public_html/
  C:\xampp\htdocs\

  Paths are machine specific, so talk to your web host if you are uncertain where this folder is.

  3. Point your web browser to the URL of your website followed by the subfolder install/ e.g. http://www.mysite.com/install/. If you placed LiteCart in a subfolder of the web root, the path should be something like http://www.mysite.com/litecart/install. The installation page should now load.

  4. Pay attention to the information on the page and make sure everything seems okay. Fill in your details for database, region, etc. Click the Install button when you are ready.

  If everything went well LiteCart should now be successfully installed.
